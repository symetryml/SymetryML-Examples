== Clustering

New with SymetryML version 5.4 is an online version of Kmeans clustering. 
The clustering algorithm is controlled by a few parameters

|=============================
| Parameter | Required/Optional? | Description
| *cluster_rnd_seed* | Optional | Set the seed of the randomizer
| *cluster_features* | Mandatory | This is a string containing the features to use for the clustering algorithm. The feature are colon separated.
| *cluster_max_iterations* | Optional | Default is *1000*. This control the number of iterations of the kmeans algorithm.
| *cluster_num_centroids* | Optional | Default is *100*. This parameter control the number of centroid that are kept in real time on the data. Typically this number is much higher than the intended number of cluster - e.g. the target 'k' parameters
| *cluster_warmup_period* | Optional | Default is *101*. This parameters control how many tuples of data must be seen before the initial real-time cluster will be constructed using the 'cluster_num_centroids' parameter as
the k number. Once the initial kluster is created it will just be updated in real-time with each new tuple/row of data. Note that *cluster_warmup_period* needs to be greater than *cluster_num_centroids*, e.g. *cluster_num_centroids*=100 and *cluster_warmup_period*=101. If this condition is not meet an error will be raised by the software.
